    Welcome to Startup Psy-Phy!<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an impromtu page to give you an idea of
    who we are and what we are working on.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working on bringing elite rehabilitation
    therapy to the wounded warriors. We specifically selected this
    population because research pointed to high prevalence of PTSD that
    develops among wounded veterans. Furthermore we zeroed in on service
    members who lost limbs to ensure we are helping those who need it
    most.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idea behind Psy-Phy is to use VR to combine
    psychological and physical therapy. This is an expensive route, but
    has shown better outcomes than the therapies being used separately.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The presentation we made for the MIT's Grand Hack can
    be viewed <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="psyphy.pdf">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Meet our team! We have a diverse team with inhouse
    expertise in mechanical engineering (VR) and various types of
    research.<br>
